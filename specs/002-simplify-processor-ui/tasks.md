# Tasks: Simplified Processor UI (002-simplify-processor-ui)

Input: `spec.md` and `plan.md`
Prerequisites: plan.md finalized

Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description (FR/SC refs)`
Legend: US1=Upload & Auto-Detect, US2=Post-Processing Filter, US3=Detection Visibility

## Phase 0: Setup / No Structural Changes Needed

- [X] T000 [P] [ALL] Confirm no new dependencies (FR-005, FR-017)

## Phase 1: Parser & Enrichment (User Story 1)

Goal: Auto-detect & enrich operations; produce group summaries.

Tests First:

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Unit test parseToken happy paths (CALL, PUT, decimal strike) (FR-004..FR-006, FR-017)
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Unit test parseToken malformed tokens -> null (FR-015)
- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Unit test enrichOperationRow precedence explicit vs token (FR-004, FR-005)
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Unit test deriveGroups aggregation counts (FR-007, FR-008, FR-016)
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Unit test non-option symbol grouping with suffix -> expiration or NONE (FR-022)
- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Unit test type classification across explicit and token-driven paths (FR-003)

Implementation:

- [X] T020 [US1] Add `parseToken` helper in `frontend/src/services/csv/process-operations.js` (FR-004, FR-005)
- [X] T021 [US1] Add enrichment logic setting `meta.detectedFromToken` (FR-006)
- [X] T022 [US1] Implement non-option row handling & placeholder expiration logic (FR-022)
- [X] T023 [US1] Implement group derivation function `deriveGroups` (FR-007, FR-008)
- [X] T024 [US1] Integrate enrichment + grouping into existing processing pipeline (FR-001, FR-002)
- [X] T025 [US1] Normalize symbol/expiration uppercase (FR-016)
- [X] T026 [US1] Ensure decimal strike parsing numeric precision (FR-017)
- [X] T027 [US1] Ensure unknown rows preserved (FR-015)
- [ ] T028 [US1] Add error collection without abort (FR-018)
- [X] T029 [US1] Update existing unit tests snapshot adjustments (SC-003 regression)
- [X] T030 [US1] Ensure classification logic emits CALL/PUT/UNKNOWN per spec (FR-003)

## Phase 2: Group Filter UI (User Story 2)

Goal: Allow post-processing filtering and scoped exports.

Tests First:

- [X] T040 [P] [US2] Integration test multi-group CSV -> groups rendered + "Todos" option (FR-009, FR-010)
- [X] T041 [P] [US2] Integration test select group filters table + counts (FR-011, FR-012, SC-005)
- [X] T042 [P] [US2] Integration test export filtered vs all (FR-013, FR-014, SC-005)
- [X] T043 [P] [US2] Integration test single group -> auto-select, no All (FR-010)

Implementation:

- [X] T050 [US2] Add groupSelection state & groups wiring in `ProcessorScreen.jsx` (FR-009, FR-010)
- [X] T051 [US2] Render group filter component (chips/select) (FR-009)
- [X] T052 [US2] Apply filtering in `OperationsTable.jsx` (FR-011)
- [X] T053 [US2] Update `SummaryPanel.jsx` counts to reflect selection (FR-012)
- [X] T054 [US2] Scope copy/export in `ProcessorActions.jsx` (FR-013)
- [X] T055 [US2] Add "Descargar todo" action (FR-014)
- [X] T056 [US2] Add Spanish strings (grupos, todos, descargarTodo, filtrarPorGrupo) (Principle 6)
- [X] T057 [US2] Memoize filtered operations for performance (SC-004)

## Phase 3: Detection Visibility (User Story 3)

Goal: Show inferred indicator for transparency.

Tests First:

- [X] T060 [P] [US3] Unit test row with meta.detectedFromToken renders indicator (FR-019)
- [X] T061 [P] [US3] Unit test row without meta flag shows no indicator (FR-019)

Implementation:

- [X] T065 [US3] Add inferred icon/tooltip in `OperationsTable.jsx` (FR-019)
- [X] T066 [US3] Add es-AR string for tooltip (filaInferidaTooltip) (Principle 6)

## Phase 4: Performance & Polish

- [ ] T070 [P] Perf measure: benchmark 500-row (<100ms), 5k-row (<6s), and 10k-row (<10s) parses on mid-tier laptop (SC-001, SC-008, SC-009)
- [ ] T071 [P] Interaction latency measure for group switch: <200ms typical, <500ms after large dataset (SC-004, SC-009)
- [X] T072 Review error handling paths & add test for malformed tokens list (SC-007)
- [X] T073 Confirm 0 lost rows vs input count (SC-003)
- [X] T074 Confirm export row count equals filtered count (SC-005)
- [X] T075 Manual UX step reduction validation record (SC-006)
- [X] T076 Update README / quickstart with new simplified flow

## Phase 5: Validation & Cleanup

- [X] T080 Remove dead code relating to pre-upload selectors (if any) (Simplicity)
- [X] T081 Final audit: all new strings localized and referenced
- [X] T082 Add documentation snippet to `quickstart.md`
- [ ] T083 Ensure no new dependencies added (Principle 5)
- [ ] T084 Final regression test suite run & green

## Dependencies & Parallelization Notes

- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2 UI filter tasks.
- Phase 2 can run in parallel with early Phase 3 test scaffolding (indicator tests can assert placeholder CSS class before actual icon asset finalization).
- Performance & polish after core stories implemented.
